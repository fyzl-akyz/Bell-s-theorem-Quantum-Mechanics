# Bell-s-theorem-Quantum-Mechanics
Infers probability according to the spin direction of subatomic particles and the angle from which they are sent.
## - About :
<p>This project is simply calculating the small probability in Bell's theorem. Particles sent to 2 separate detectors can be sent at different angles or at the same angles. So you read the value in the detector. If the signs on the 2 detectors are opposite, they give similar colors. But if the directions are not opposite, the colors are different.</p>
 
 ## - Install prerequisites :
  1.Install Python 3.10.3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3103/)
  2.Download .py files.
  Note : You must need "coloroma"  for python file.
